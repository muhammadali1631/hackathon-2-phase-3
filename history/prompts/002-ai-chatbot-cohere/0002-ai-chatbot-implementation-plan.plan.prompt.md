## Prompt

Implementation Plan for Phase III – AI Todo Chatbot (Cohere-Powered Integration)
Create:

Updated backend architecture diagram showing how Cohere + custom agent runner fits into existing FastAPI server
New database schema extensions (Conversation and Message models) with relationships to users
MCP-compatible tool definitions in Cohere format (JSON schema for tool calling)
Custom Cohere Runner class / function that mimics OpenAI Agents SDK behavior (chat → tool call detection → execution → final response)
Chat endpoint logic flow: auth → load history → call Cohere → execute tools → save messages → return response
Frontend chatbot UI integration plan: floating icon, modal/chat window, message streaming simulation, typing indicator
Environment variable & security checklist (COHERE_API_KEY, domain allowlist prep)
Error & fallback strategy document (tool failure, rate limit, invalid JWT)

Decisions needing documentation:

Cohere model choice: command-r-plus (better reasoning/tool use) vs command-r (faster, cheaper) → Choose command-r-plus for best tool-calling accuracy in hackathon demo
Tool calling implementation: Use Cohere native tool calling vs force JSON mode → Native tool calling (more reliable, supports parallel calls)
Chat UI technology: Hosted OpenAI ChatKit vs custom React + Tailwind component → Hybrid: Try hosted ChatKit first (configure domain allowlist), fallback to custom lightweight modal if setup fails
Floating icon style: Circular FAB vs chat bubble icon → Modern circular FAB with subtle pulse animation on new messages (inspired by WhatsApp/Telegram)
Message history limit: Unlimited vs truncate after N messages → Truncate to last 20 messages per conversation (prevents token blowup)
Tool execution order: Sequential vs parallel when multiple tools called → Parallel execution when possible (Cohere supports it)
Response streaming: Full response vs simulate typing → Simulate typing effect in frontend (no real streaming from Cohere in basic setup)
Conversation naming: Auto-generate from first message vs manual → Auto-generate short title from first user message

Testing strategy (validation against success criteria):

Natural language task commands: Test 10+ variations ("Add task buy milk", "Show all tasks", "Mark task 3 done", "Delete the first one", "Change task 2 to call mom")
Profile queries: "Mera email kya hai?", "Who am I logged in as?", "Mera naam batao" → correct data returned
Context preservation: Send 5 messages, restart backend, continue same conversation_id → history intact
Security: Try accessing chat without JWT → 401; try task operations for wrong user_id → 403 or no data
Tool calls visibility: Check response.tool_calls array shows correct tools invoked
UI integration: Floating icon appears only when logged in; chat window opens/closes smoothly; messages display correctly
Multilingual: Test Urdu commands ("Ek task add karo grocery khareedne ka") → understood and executed
Edge cases: Empty message, very long input, task not found, duplicate task title, rate limit simulation
End-to-end: Signup → login → open chat → manage tasks → see updates in main task list UI

Technical details:

Use spec-concurrent approach: Implement backend chatbot logic first, then frontend UI, iterate with @specs references
Cohere integration: cohere.Client with api_key from env, tools defined as list of dicts (name, description, parameters schema)
Custom runner: Function that takes history + new message → calls cohere.chat() → if tool_calls → execute via existing FastAPI route logic or direct DB calls → feed results back → final response
DB: Use SQLModel to define Conversation(user_id, id, title?, created_at) and Message(conversation_id, role, content, created_at)
Frontend: Add /components/ChatbotIcon.tsx, /components/ChatWindow.tsx; use existing api.ts to call /api/{user_id}/chat
JWT: Reuse get_current_user dependency → pass user_id to tools automatically

Organize by phases:

Foundation
→ Add COHERE_API_KEY to .env
→ Extend DB schema: Conversation + Message models
→ Create tools list in Cohere-compatible format (add_task, list_tasks, ..., get_user_profile)
Backend – Chat Endpoint & Agent Runner
→ Implement POST /api/{user_id}/chat (protected)
→ Build custom CohereRunner: load history, call Cohere, handle tool calls, save messages
→ Integrate existing task & user logic as tool executors
MCP Tools Implementation
→ Code each tool function (add_task → DB insert, list_tasks → query with filter, etc.)
→ Ensure every tool enforces user_id ownership
Frontend – Chatbot UI
→ Add floating chatbot icon (visible only logged-in)
→ Create chat modal/window with message list, input, send button
→ Implement message sending to backend + display responses
→ Add typing indicator + auto-scroll
Polish & Optimizations
→ Friendly response formatting (action confirmations, emojis)
→ Error handling in UI (connection lost, invalid response)
→ Dark mode consistency with main app
→ Performance: Limit history sent to Cohere (last 15–20 messages)
Final Integration & Review
→ Full end-to-end testing: chat controls tasks → main UI reflects changes
→ Verify no regressions in Phase II CRUD
→ Document domain allowlist setup for ChatKit (if used)
→ Judges-ready demo flow: login → chat → manage tasks conversationally

This plan ensures a clean, powerful, Cohere-powered AI chatbot that feels like a natural 2026 upgrade to your existing premium Todo app – fully integrated, secure, delightful, and spec-driven from start to finish.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the implementation plan for the AI Todo Chatbot Integration feature. The following artifacts were generated:

1. Implementation plan (plan.md) - Complete architecture overview with structure decisions and constitution compliance
2. Research summary (research.md) - Key technical decisions documented with rationale
3. Data model (data-model.md) - Detailed entity definitions for Conversation and Message models
4. Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) - Step-by-step setup instructions for local development
5. API contract (contracts/chat-api.yaml) - Detailed API specification for the chat endpoint
6. Updated agent context (CLAUDE.md) - Added new technologies and frameworks to the agent context

The plan addresses all specified requirements including Cohere integration, tool calling, conversation persistence, and frontend UI integration. All constitution requirements have been validated and confirmed as compliant.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan with all required artifacts generated
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for planning phase
- 📁 Files: Created 5 new files and updated CLAUDE.md with new technology stack
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan comprehensively covers all technical aspects while maintaining compliance with project constitution

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to task generation phase with /sp.tasks
