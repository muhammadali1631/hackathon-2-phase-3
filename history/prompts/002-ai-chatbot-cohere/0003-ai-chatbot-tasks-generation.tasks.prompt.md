## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the AI Todo Chatbot Integration feature. The tasks.md file includes:

- 80 specific, actionable tasks organized by implementation phases
- Clear task format with checkboxes, IDs, and story labels
- Phase organization from Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish
- Parallel execution opportunities marked with [P] labels
- Dependencies between user stories clearly defined
- Independent test criteria for each user story
- Implementation strategy prioritizing MVP delivery

The tasks cover all aspects of the feature including backend services (ChatService, ToolsService), data models (Conversation, Message), API endpoints, frontend components (ChatWindow, ChatbotIcon), and integration with Cohere's AI services.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for AI chatbot implementation with 80 specific tasks
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for task generation phase
- 📁 Files: Created comprehensive tasks.md file with structured implementation plan
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation with /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user stories allowing independent development and testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with first phase tasks
